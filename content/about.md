<!-- I am fascinated by scientific software development, scientific computing, data analysis, and visualization. I love most to read, write, and teach. I am an engineer who works with a progressive mind for development, science, learning, and new experiences. -->

<!-- This is my website/blog that I first created for my summer internship in Gaithersburg, Maryland, at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in 2007. It continues to grow with content related to my studies, life, and passions in everyday explorations. -->

<!-- For the first part of my life, I grew up in the wonderful state of Texas (Houston). From 2004 to 2008, I attended the University of Houston-Downtown (UHD) and earned a B.S. in Fire Protection Engineering Technology. In 2008, I moved to Massachusetts to attend Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). I finished one and a half years later and obtained a M.S. degree in Fire Protection Engineering. -->

<!-- In, 2010, I moved back to my home state of Texas to pursue a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) in the UT Fire Research Group. While studying at UT Austin, I was also teaching engineering courses at UHD. -->

<!-- After completing my Ph.D. in 2013, I moved to Maryland to work as a fire protection engineer at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. -->

<!-- In 2015, I moved to Austin, TX, to work as a software engineer at Continuum Analytics on scientific software development and scientific computing. -->

<!-- In 2018, I joined the RStudio team as a solutions engineer working on enterprise data science tools and products. -->

<!-- I want to teach and help grow my engineering experiences both locally in Texas and globally. I want to learn, share, and fully participate in this new informational era of community-driven organization and discovery. My subject of choice aside, I hope to follow my passions without hesitation, and I want to pass that along to others. -->

<!-- On this website, I hope to communicate out the ideas and life-grabbing concepts that I come across during my journey. -->
